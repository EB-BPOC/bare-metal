The objective of this project is to extend the bare-metal provisioning support in OpenStack to xCat. The xCat is an 
open-source solution providing bare-metal provisioning, deployment and resource management for a wide variety of platforms. By xCat, we can enhance bare-metal provisioning of OpenStack to support what platforms xCat supports. No doubt, it is of significance to both xCat and OpenStack.
